<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! He is here.</p>

    <li>What?!</li>
    <li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
    <li>What?!</li>
    <li>Don't underestimate the Force.</li>

<p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I find your lack of faith disturbing. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
<h3>Attack of the Clones</h3>
<p>What!? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>

    <li>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</li>
    <li>I call it luck.</li>

<h3>Jedi Academy</h3>
<p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. Red Five standing by. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't underestimate the Force. He is here.</p>
