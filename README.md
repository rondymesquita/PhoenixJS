# PhoenixJS

## Proposal
- Create an CMS free of server languages, using technologies like javascript, HTML, CSS and Markdown.
- Build on top of AngularJS, you can create your posts using markdown language.
- Create templates using HTML and CSS.
- Extend with AngularJS
- Create your own themes

### Requirements
- Bower
- AngularJS
- JQuery

#### Basic
- Put themes in **app/themes** folder following the structure
    - [THEME]
        - --- footer
        - --- header
        - --- posts
            - --- view.html (view the post)
            - --- list.html (list all posts)
            - --- byCategory.html (list posts by category)
            - --- sidebar (idem)



#### This structure may change in the near future :)
